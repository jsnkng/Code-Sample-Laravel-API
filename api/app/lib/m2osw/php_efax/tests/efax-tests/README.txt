These files are used to test PHP e-Fax.

The fax-server.php file is used to test a transmission result from a server.
Note that requires your server to be setup to run PHP and transmit the
results of this test page back to the test.

The files with .php4 require you to run PHP 4.x with the Net directory
accessible from the test location (look into PEAR for the Net files).

There is a script in the bin directory that you can run to run all the
tests: bin/efax_test

Files here are only for test purposes. Do not try to use for anything
else.
